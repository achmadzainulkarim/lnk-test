    Here's an updated guide on how to generate an app password for your Gmail account:

    1. Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/.
    1. Navigate to the "Security" tab.
    1. Look for the "Signing in to Google" section.
    1. Find the "App passwords" option. If you don't see this option, it might be because your account has Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled.
    1. If you have 2FA enabled, you may need to go to the "Security" > "Two-Factor Authentication" section. Enable 2FA if you haven't already.
    1. Once 2FA is enabled, go back to the "Security" > "App passwords" section.
    1. Choose the app and device you want to generate the app password for.
    1. Click on "Generate."
    1. Google will provide you with a 16-character app password.
    Use this app password in your Node.js application instead of your regular Gmail password.

    `Note: App passwords are a more secure way to allow access to your Google account from third-party apps. It's a specific password generated for a particular app, and you can revoke it at any time without affecting your main Google account password.`
